caveats:
  - heading: How these crimes are counted
    text: Arson is the willful or malicious burning or attempting to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house, public building, motor vehicle, aircraft, or personal property of another. Only the fires that investigation determined to have been willfully set are included here. Fires labeled as suspicious or of unknown origin are excluded from the data.

  - heading: Arson-related deaths and injuries
    text: The Uniform Crime Reporting Program does not include arson-related deaths and injuries of police officers and firefighters, unless they were determined to be willful murders or assaults, due to the hazardous nature of these professions.
