caveats:
  - heading: How agencies investigate hate crimes
    text: Hate crimes are motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against a race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, and were committed against people, property, or society. Because motivation is subjective, it is sometimes difficult to know with certainty whether a crime resulted from the offender’s bias. The presence of bias alone does not necessarily mean that a crime can be considered a hate crime. Only when a law enforcement investigation reveals sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by their bias, should an agency report an incident as a hate crime.
  - heading: Types of incidents
    text: The FBI collects data about both single-bias and multiple-bias hate crimes. A single-bias incident includes one or more offenses that were motivated by the same bias. Beginning in 2013, law enforcement agencies could report up to five bias motivations per offense type. Therefore, the definition of a multiple-bias incident has been revised to an incident in which one or more offenses were motivated by two or more biases.
  - heading: Avoid rankings or comparisons
    text: Valid assessments about crime, including hate crime, are possible only with careful study and analysis of the various conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction. Some of this data may not be comparable to prior hate crime statistics because of differing levels of participation from year to year.
