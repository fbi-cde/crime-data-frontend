caveats:
  - heading: How these crimes are counted
    text: Robbery involves taking or trying to take something of value from a victim by force or threat of force. Law enforcement agencies should classify cases involving a pretend or concealed weapon as robbery and report the alleged weapon. Because assault is an element of the crime, agencies should not report a separate assault offense as long as the offender committed the assault to commit the robbery. However, if the injury results in death, law enforcement must also report a homicide.

  - heading: Victim’s relationship to offender
    text: Until 2016, the FBI recorded all same-sex couples as acquaintances under the “Homosexual Relationship” label. This category is no longer in use. After same-sex marriage was [upheld as a constitutional right in 2015](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf), the FBI started collecting data about crimes against same-sex partners as “Spouse” (if married) or “Boyfriend or Girlfriend” (if not married).
