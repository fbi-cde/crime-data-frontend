caveats:
  - heading: How these crimes are counted
    text: As a general rule, any death caused by injuries received in a fight, argument, quarrel, assault, or commission of a crime is classified as murder or nonnegligent manslaughter. The FBI counts one offense for each victim of murder or nonnegligent manslaughter. Accidental deaths, traffic fatalities, suicides, negligent manslaughters, justifiable homicides, or attempted murders are not included.

  - heading: Victim’s relationship to offender
    text: Until 2016, the FBI recorded all same-sex couples as acquaintances under the “Homosexual Relationship” label. This category is no longer in use. After same-sex marriage was [upheld as a constitutional right in 2015](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf), the FBI started collecting data about crimes against same-sex partners as “Spouse” (if married) or “Boyfriend or Girlfriend” (if not married).
