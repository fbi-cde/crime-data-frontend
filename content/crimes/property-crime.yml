caveats:
  - heading: Related offenses
    text: Property crime includes the offenses of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. The object of theft offenses is money or property, but there is no force or threat of force against the victims. The property crime category includes arson because the offense involves the destruction of property; however, arson victims may be subjected to force.

  - heading: How these crimes are counted
    text: This data reflects the Hierarchy Rule, which requires that only the most serious offense in a case be counted. The descending order of violent crimes are homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, followed by the property crimes of burglary, larceny theft, and motor vehicle theft. Although arson is also a property crime, the Hierarchy Rule does not apply to it. In cases in which an arson occurs in conjunction with another violent or property crime, both crimes are reported.
