  - heading: How these crimes are counted
    text: "Burglary is the unlawful entry into a building or structure to commit a felony or theft. The FBI has three subclassifications for burglary: forcible entry, unlawful entry where no force is used, and attempted forcible entry. Structures include apartments, barns, trailers or houseboats when used as a permanent dwelling, office buildings, railroad cars (but not automobiles), stables, ships, and vessels."

  - heading: Hotel rule
    text: "When a number of hotel rooms, motel rooms, or self-storage units are burglarized, the building manager is more likely to report the offenses to the police than individual tenants. In these cases, the law enforcement agency should report a single burglary incident to the FBI and include the number of premises that were entered."
