caveats:
  - heading: Change in rape definition
    text: |
      In 2013, the FBI started collecting rape data under a revised definition and removed “forcible” from the offense name. All reported rape incidents—whether collected under the revised definition or the legacy definition—are presented here. Since the rape definition changed, some state and local law enforcement agencies have continued to report incidents with the legacy definition, because they haven't been able to change their records management systems to accommodate the change.

  - heading: How these crimes are counted
    text: The Uniform Crime Reporting Program counts one offense for each victim of rape, attempted rape, or assault to commit rape, regardless of the victim’s age. Sexual relations involving a family member without consent are counted as rape, not incest. Statutory rape and incest are excluded.

  - heading: Victim’s relationship to offender
    text: Until 2016, the FBI recorded all same-sex couples as acquaintances under the “Homosexual Relationship” label. This category is no longer in use. After same-sex marriage was [upheld as a constitutional right in 2015](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf), the FBI started collecting data about crimes against same-sex partners as “Spouse” (if married) or “Boyfriend or Girlfriend” (if not married).
