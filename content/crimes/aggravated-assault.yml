  - heading: How these crimes are counted
    text: Aggravated assault is an unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. This type of assault is usually accompanied by the use of a weapon or by other means likely to produce death or bodily harm. Attempted aggravated assault that involves the display of or threat to use a gun, knife, or other weapon is included in this crime category because serious personal injury would likely result. When aggravated assault and larceny theft occur together, the offense is categorized as robbery.

  - heading: Victim’s relationship to offender
    text: Until 2016, the FBI recorded all same-sex couples as acquaintances under the “Homosexual Relationship” label. This category is no longer in use. After same-sex marriage was [upheld as a constitutional right in 2015](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf), the FBI started collecting data about crimes against same-sex partners as “Spouse” (if married) or “Boyfriend or Girlfriend” (if not married).

  - heading: Information about simple assaults
    text: Assaults that do not involve a dangerous weapon or serious injuries are reported as simple assaults under the FBI’s arrest data.
